# Baffle

Baffle is a word search game, similar to Boggle, but played on a hexagon.

The solving algorithm is heavily adapted from, but originally based on, code from Peter Norvig's Python [Boggle-solver](http://aima-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/search.py) in [Artifical Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).

My goal is to have it work across all mobile devices and desktop browsers, and to have a fun game that I enjoy playing. It still needs some work on playability and a better dictionary. Feedback and suggestions are appreciated.
